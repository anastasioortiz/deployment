# Known Bugs
The one bug I could not fix is that the filter is off by one in the clicking. If you try to filter out the grass pokemon for example nothing will happen if you then try to filter out the fire pokemon the grass pokemon will filter out. If you then try to filter the grass pokemon back in the fire pokemon will be filtered out. I understood that this is an issue with callback functions and the way I implemented react states, however, when I went to TA Hours it couldn't be resolved so I decided to move on.
